###########BEFORE###########################

Automated protien ID/Data to some extent - Needs improvment
Dataset Cleaning 
Dataset *Compatibility
Dataset Analysis
Have dataset of known, verified complexes
What does the Dataset output?
Search for Github Repos doing similar things
Search for Papers doing similar things
Barrier: No exact method being followed
Limitation of data extraction
Setup a DB containing protien info - END GOAL FOR EVALS
Document everything better for final report and presentation

What does the database include:

PPIN of known validity - species[multi, or singular], part of body, validating metrics,  
Protiens with known properties, gene-name, species, interaction score, function, part-of-body.
Protiens with unknown propeties

Output[INPUT TO PIPELINE]

Sample Queries [NEED TO BE VALID]
- PPI of a certain part of the body 
- PPI of a certain species
- PPI between two species
  
#############AFTER#######################
Algorithm Work

Haris and Usaid Work:

Given some PPIN -> Identify protien complexes - Cliques, or
other topological structures

Factor information such as interaction score of protiens
when prediction complexes

Enhance the data by identifying properties of protiens with
unkown properties
