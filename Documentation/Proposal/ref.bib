    abstract = "{Protein complexes are the fundamental units for many cellular processes. Identifying protein complexes accurately is critical for understanding the functions and organizations of cells. With the increment of genome-scale protein–protein interaction (PPI) data for different species, various computational methods focus on identifying protein complexes from PPI networks. In this article, we give a comprehensive and updated review on the state-of-the-art computational methods in the field of protein complex identification, especially focusing on the newly developed approaches. The computational methods are organized into three categories, including cluster-quality-based methods, node-affinity-based methods and ensemble clustering methods. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of different methods are discussed, and then, the performance of 17 state-of-the-art methods is evaluated on two widely used benchmark data sets. Finally, the bottleneck problems and their potential solutions in this important field are discussed.}",

	abstract = {Various algorithms have been proposed to identify protein complexes from PPI networks, based on the assumption that protein complexes are densely connected subgraphs. In this study, we conclude that most known protein complexes do not exhibit dense structures in S. cerevisiae PPI network, but maintain starlike structures in the network. Moreover, vertices of protein complexes are not sparsely connected with the rest components of the network. Many vertices tend to have more outgoing interactions than they have within protein complexes. Based on starlike properties of known protein complexes, we propose a random-star algorithm to identify protein complexes in PPI networks. Predictions are evaluated in terms of the average f-score. After excluding similar clusters, we finally obtaine 744 predictions with the average f-score at 0.51.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Protein complexes integrate multiple gene products to coordinate many biological functions. Given a graph representing pairwise protein interaction data one can search for subgraphs representing protein complexes. Previous methods for performing such search relied on the assumption that complexes form a clique in that graph. While this assumption is true for some complexes, it does not hold for many others. New algorithms are required in order to recover complexes with other types of topological structure., Results: We present an algorithm for inferring protein complexes from weighted interaction graphs. By using graph topological patterns and biological properties as features, we model each complex subgraph by a probabilistic Bayesian network (BN). We use a training set of known complexes to learn the parameters of this BN model. The log-likelihood ratio derived from the BN is then used to score subgraphs in the protein interaction graph and identify new complexes. We applied our method to protein interaction data in yeast. As we show our algorithm achieved a considerable improvement over clique based algorithms in terms of its ability to recover known complexes. We discuss some of the new complexes predicted by our algorithm and determine that they likely represent true complexes., Availability: Matlab implementation is available on the supporting website: www.cs.cmu.edu/{\textasciitilde}qyj/SuperComplex, Contact: zivbj@cs.cmu.edu},

	doi = {10.1109/TCBB.2012.20},
	abstract = {Detecting protein complexes from protein interaction networks is one major task in the postgenome era. Previous developed computational algorithms identifying complexes mainly focus on graph partition or dense region finding. Most of these traditional algorithms cannot discover overlapping complexes which really exist in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Even if some density-based methods have been developed to identify overlapping complexes, they are not able to discover complexes that include peripheral proteins. In this study, motivated by recent successful application of generative network model to describe the generation process of PPI networks and to detect communities from social networks, we develop a regularized sparse generative network model (RSGNM), by adding another process that generates propensities using exponential distribution and incorporating Laplacian regularizer into an existing generative network model, for protein complexes identification. By assuming that the propensities are generated using exponential distribution, the estimators of propensities will be sparse, which not only has good biological interpretation but also helps to control the overlapping rate among detected complexes. And the Laplacian regularizer will lead to the estimators of propensities more smooth on interaction networks. Experimental results on three yeast PPI networks show that RSGNM outperforms six previous competing algorithms in terms of the quality of detected complexes. In addition, RSGNM is able to detect overlapping complexes and complexes including peripheral proteins simultaneously. These results give new insights about the importance of generative network models in protein complexes identification.},
