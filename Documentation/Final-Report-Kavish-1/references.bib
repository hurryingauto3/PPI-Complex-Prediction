	abstract = {With the increasing development of biotechnology and informatics technology, publicly available data in chemistry and biology are undergoing explosive growth. Such wealthy information in these data needs to be extracted and transformed to useful knowledge by various data mining methods. Considering the amazing rate at which data are accumulated in chemistry and biology fields, new tools that process and interpret large and complex interaction data are increasingly important. So far, there are no suitable toolkits that can effectively link the chemical and biological space in view of molecular representation. To further explore these complex data, an integrated toolkit for various molecular representation is urgently needed which could be easily integrated with data mining algorithms to start a full data analysis pipeline. Herein, the python library PyBioMed is presented, which comprises functionalities for online download for various molecular objects by providing different IDs, the pretreatment of molecular structures, the computation of various molecular descriptors for chemicals, proteins, DNAs and their interactions. PyBioMed is a feature-rich and highly customized python library used for the characterization of various complex chemical and biological molecules and interaction samples. The current version of PyBioMed could calculate 775 chemical descriptors and 19 kinds of chemical fingerprints, 9920 protein descriptors based on protein sequences, more than 6000 DNA descriptors from nucleotide sequences, and interaction descriptors from pairwise samples using three different combining strategies. Several examples and five real-life applications were provided to clearly guide the users how to use PyBioMed as an integral part of data analysis projects. By using PyBioMed, users are able to start a full pipelining from getting molecular data, pretreating molecules, molecular representation to constructing machine learning models conveniently. PyBioMed provides various user-friendly and highly customized APIs to calculate various features of biological molecules and complex interaction samples conveniently, which aims at building integrated analysis pipelines from data acquisition, data checking, and descriptor calculation to modeling. PyBioMed is freely available at http://projects.scbdd.com/pybiomed.html .},

Identifying them plays an important role for our attempt to reveal principles of cellular organizations and functions. In this article, we review computational algorithms for identifying protein complexes and/or functional modules from protein {\textasciicircum} protein interaction (PPI) networks. We first describe issues and pitfalls when interpreting PPI networks. Then based on types of data used and main ideas involved, we briefly describe protein complex and/or functional module identification algorithms in four categories: (i) those based on topological structures of unweighted PPI networks; (ii) those based on characters of weighted PPI networks; (iii) those based on multiple data integrations; and (iv) those based on dynamic PPI networks. The PPI networks are modelled increasingly precise when integrating more types of data, and the study of protein complexes would benefit by shifting from static to dynamic PPI networks.},

            Protein complexes are the fundamental units for many cellular processes. Identifying protein complexes accurately is critical for understanding the functions and organizations of cells. With the increment of genome-scale protein–protein interaction (PPI) data for different species, various computational methods focus on identifying protein complexes from PPI networks. In this article, we give a comprehensive and updated review on the state-of-the-art computational methods in the field of protein complex identification, especially focusing on the newly developed approaches. The computational methods are organized into three categories, including cluster-quality-based methods, node-affinity-based methods and ensemble clustering methods. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of different methods are discussed, and then, the performance of 17 state-of-the-art methods is evaluated on two widely used benchmark data sets. Finally, the bottleneck problems and their potential solutions in this important field are discussed.},

	title = {Detecting dense communities in large social and information networks with the {Core} \& {Peel} algorithm},
	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3266v1},
	abstract = {Detecting and characterizing dense subgraphs (tight communities) in social and information networks is an important exploratory tool in social network analysis. Several approaches have been proposed that either (i) partition the whole network into clusters, even in low density region, or (ii) are aimed at finding a single densest community (and need to be iterated to find the next one). As social networks grow larger both approaches (i) and (ii) result in algorithms too slow to be practical, in particular when speed in analyzing the data is required. In this paper we propose an approach that aims at balancing efficiency of computation and expressiveness and manageability of the output community representation. We define the notion of a partial dense cover (PDC) of a graph. Intuitively a PDC of a graph is a collection of sets of nodes that (a) each set forms a disjoint dense induced subgraphs and (b) its removal leaves the residual graph without dense regions. Exact computation of PDC is an NP-complete problem, thus, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithms for computing a PDC which we christen Core and Peel. Moreover we propose a novel benchmarking technique that allows us to evaluate algorithms for computing PDC using the classical IR concepts of precision and recall even without a golden standard. Tests on 25 social and technological networks from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection confirm that Core and Peel is efficient and attains very high precison and recall.},
