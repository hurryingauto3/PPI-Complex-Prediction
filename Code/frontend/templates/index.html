        Project Background and Motivation
    </h2>

    <div>
        Proteins are essential to the survival to all lifeforms present on the planet.
        They carry out several functions and are present in a vast variety in our
        ecosystem, to the point where many remain unknown in their function,
        properties, and structure. It is then of great importance to be able to
        identify proteins. A form of proteins are protein complexes. These are
        proteins that are formed as a result of multiple proteins bonded together.
        These protein complexes play a pivotal role in drug discovery, understand-
        ing viral receptor binding, etc.

        The scope of our project is to further the prediction of these protein com-
        plexes by making use of protein-protein interaction data available. The
        interactions can be modelled as a combinatorial graph and thus become
        open to analysis that comprise of graph theoretical techniques. Protein
        complexes are often present in these networks as subgraphs, or cliques.
        Therefore, our problem statement is to find cliques within these large net-
        works - an NP complete problem. We will be making use of topological,
        and biological data along with an ensemble clustering framework that al-
        lows for much more holistic results.
