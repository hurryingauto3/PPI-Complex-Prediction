<p>
Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) is an integral process for the creation of protein complexes that are responsible for various biological functions,. The study of PPI helps us determine the attributes and functions of any particular protein and hence, is an important area of research. Current research and work on PPI networks revolves around the usage of genetic algorithms and Deep learning to predict the complexes formed by interaction networks. These computational methods, however, have their own limitations as they are usually static and assume uniformity between PPI in cells while real PPI is dependent on other factors. The current computational algorithms also use datasets which are incomplete and unreliable due to technical biases. Apart from that they also are only able to identify large, dense molecules unlike those found in real life which are small and sparse. We plan to tackle these issues and gear our research towards 3 main areas of development:
<ul>
    <li>An approach to work with dynamic PPI networks to account for various missing factors that static PPI networks overlook. </li>
    <li>Use of generative models to adjust for the incomplete datasets</li>
    <li>Use of ensemble clustering methods to adjust for various differences in protein complexes</li>
  </ul>
